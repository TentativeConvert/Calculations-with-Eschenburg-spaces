>>   1109545 to 1109585 different homotopy classes in this range

!! The count is imprecise because condition C fails for 40 non-singleton parameter vectors.          
In the statistics and the lists below, the homotopy classes of these non-singleton parameter vectors
are (probably incorrectly) identified with homotopy classes defined by other parameter vectors.     
So the actual number of singletons may be higher than the number displayed, while
   the actual number of pairs/triples/... may be smaller.

>>   1091656 homotopy classes defined by just 1 parameter vector (k1,k2,k3,l1,l2,l3)
>>     17648 homotopy classes defined by 2 different parameter vectors
>>       241 homotopy classes defined by 3 different parameter vectors
