>> 916986361 to 916986362 different homeomorphism classes in this range

!! The count is imprecise because, for some spaces, condition C fails, and the
!! computable parameters do not suffice to determine their homeomorphism classes. 

In the statistics and the lists below, the homeomorphism classes of these spaces
are (probably incorrectly) identified with homeomorphism classes of other spaces.
So the actual number of singletons may be higher than the number displayed, while
   the actual number of pairs/triples/... may be smaller.

>> 916985125 homeomorphism classes defined by just 1 parameter vector (k1,k2,k3,l1,l2,l3)
>>      1236 homeomorphism classes defined by 2 different parameter vectors
