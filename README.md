Fairly random calculations of invariants of Eschenburg spaces.  Possibly not of general interest.


"basic invariants":  r, s, p_1

    r, s, s_22      coincide  =>  spaces homotopy equivalent
    r, s, s_22, p_1 coincide  =>  spaces tangentially homotopy equivalent

If values of s_2 differ, then spaces are not homeomorphic.
  

We use "standard parametrization" of positively curved Eschenburg spaces with |r| < R by quadruples (k1, k2, l1, l2) with

    R >=  k1 >= k2 > l1 >= l2 >= 0

-- see [CEZ06, Lemma 1.4] and [CEZ06, proof of Prop. 1.7].

These spaces are indeed positively curved:
By the chosen normalization,

    min(l1,l2,l3) = l3 = 0
    max(l1,l2,l3) = l1
    k1, k2 > l1
    k3 = l1 + l2 - k1 - k2 < 0.

So the conditions

    ki != min(l)
    ki != max(l)

[CEZ06, (1.2)] are automatically satisfied.
