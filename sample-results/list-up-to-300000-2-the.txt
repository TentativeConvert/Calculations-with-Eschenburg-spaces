>> 916985570 to 916985571 different tangential homotopy classes in this range

!! The count is imprecise because, for some spaces, condition C fails, and the
!! computable parameters do not suffice to determine their tangential homotopy classes. 

In the statistics and the lists below, the tangential homotopy classes of these spaces
are (probably incorrectly) identified with tangential homotopy classes of other spaces.
So the actual number of singletons may be higher than the number displayed, while
   the actual number of pairs/triples/... may be smaller.

>> 916983543 tangential homotopy classes defined by just 1 parameter vector (k1,k2,k3,l1,l2,l3)
>>      2027 tangential homotopy classes defined by 2 different parameter vectors
